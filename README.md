### 1. Battery Management Systems - BMS

The BMS PCB is responsible for the voltage and temperature measurements of each battery cell of the system. The LTC6811 IC from Analog Devices is used for each segment of the battery pack and the schematic circuit along with the PCB in 3D view are presented below.

### 2. Brake System Plausibility Device - BSPD PCB

The BSPD PCB is a safety circuit which disables the HV Power Supply of the motors controller in case the driver presses simultaniously the gas pedal and the brake pedal very hard. It consists of some active analog filters that filter the input signals of the sensors, the there are some comparators and then some digital logic that controls the relay switch that enables and disables the HV system. The schematic of the circuit is shown below.
